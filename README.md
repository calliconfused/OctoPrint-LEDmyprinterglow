# OctoPrint-LEDmyprinterglow

Howdy Buddies,
This is my first version of "LED my printer glow". It's a small (and at the moment a poor) plugin for OctoPrint to control LED strips.

You can check my page on <a href="http://www.rapidforge.de/2016/02/led-my-printer-glow/">http://www.rapidforge.de/2016/02/led-my-printer-glow/</a> to see how it works.

I didn't realized the automatic installer for OctoPrint yet (maybe I'm too stupid).

Feel free to comment or, it's better, try to support this nice little application.
